      <h2>Context</h2>

      <div class="sub7"><p>
        Meetup has had 2 previous attempts at creating a design system - both were far from complete due to lots of restructuring and change in management in recent times. By the beginning of 2021, the entire design team had turned over, leaving no legacy knowledge holder about why design decisions were the way they were.
        <br /><br />
        Without a common component library to work out of, the designers were left to maintain consistency across the product by doing adhoc audits. Lots of mutation were created.
        </p>
        </div>

    </div>

    <div class="projectContent bBreak">
      <h2>Audit</h2>
      <div class="sub7">
        <p>
        Designers had began adding components on the fly in an attempt to stop the bleeding and establish some consistency. However, these figma component were often slightly different from what we had in production. Additionally, designers would sometimes make adhoc &#39;improvements&#39; as they created &amp; componentizes elements. This started creating a dangerous situation where we had multiple conflicting sources of truth, so it was time to take a step back and start the right way.
        <br /><br />
        I led our team of designers and began auditing our product to see what was already used, where they were used, and documented the mutations that existed.
        <br /><br />
        <img src="assets/meetup/designsystem/iconAudit.png" alt="icon audit">
        <br /><br />
        As was expected with an 18 year old product - we found many version of the product, with many fragments of previous versions of design systems &amp; visual identities.

      <h2>Structure</h2>
      <div class="sub7">
        <p>
        Before jumping into Figma and building, we wanted to make sure that our system was set up to be as easy as possible to maintain and work out of.
        <br /><br>
        I set up a 2 part library structure with a &#34;DS foundations&#34; library containing all of the atomic elements shared across the platforms in addition to a supplemental platform level library for each of the 4 platforms we supported &#40;Web, iOS, Android, Email&#41;
        <br /><br />
        This setup allowed us to maintain shared elements like color, typography, spacing, icons, etc. in one place &amp; without redundancy. This also separated the most important style &amp; components into a different file from the platform level library, allowing us to have a more restrictive permission on the Foundation library so accidents that had wider impacts were less likely.
        <br /><br />
        we enabled Foundations plus one supplemental platform library by default for each team space in Figma to keep decisions like &#34;which library should I use?&#34; out of the designer&#39;s workflow.

      <div class="sub7">
        <p>
          This setup helped us maintain a system that allowed for multiple sets platform specific high-level components and patterns while never having to expose more than 1 set of assets per type to any team space for designer to choose from.

      <h2>Managing scope</h2>
      <div class="sub7">
        <p>
          Working on an established product means there are already lots of components in production. Many of those elements no longer worked - sometimes for a hard reason like not passing accessibility, and other times for soft reasons like looking dated.
          <br /><br />
          An good example of this was our primary peach color &mdash;

      <div class="sub7">
        <p>
          This color was everywhere &amp; used for all of the most important things on Meetup. It was fun, energetic, and long associated with the Meetup brand. Unfornately, it was also an intentionally desaturated color. This made our most important color very hard to work with in a product. It was just about impossible to get this color &amp; all of the buttons, copy, etc. to pass contrast without it becoming something completely unrecognizable.

        With every new component we added to the library, we used the elements to recreate existing page to ensure pixel perfection. Through this process, we teased out and fixed the short comings of our components and made sure that any deviation from code was intentional and purposeful.

        To ensure that design files always reflect the product that would actually be built, we held regular meetings with designer and engineers as well as kept our Storybook repository up to date.
