      <h1>Meetup Design System</h1>
      <p>Driving UI consistency and quality across the company &plus; ensuring parity between design &amp; code.</p>


    </div>



    <div class="projectContent bBreak">
      <br /><br />
      <h2>Context</h2>

      <div class="sub7">
        <p>
          Meetup has had 2 previous attempts at creating a design system - both were far from complete due to lots of restructuring and change in management in recent times. By the beginning of 2021, the entire design team had turned over, leaving no
          legacy knowledge holder about why design decisions were the way they were.
          <br /><br />
          Without a common component library, the designers were left to maintain consistency across the product by doing adhoc audits. Lots of mutation were created.
        </p>
      </div>

    </div>

    <div class="projectContent bBreak">
      <h2>Audit</h2>
      <div class="sub7">
        <p>
          Our figma components were often slightly different from what we had in production. Additionally, designers would sometimes make adhoc &#39;improvements&#39; as they created &amp; componentizes elements. This started creating a dangerous
          situation where we had multiple conflicting sources of truth, so it was time to take a step back and start the right way.
          <br /><br />
          I led our team of designers and began auditing our product to see what was already used, where they were used, and documented the mutations that existed.
          <br /><br /><br />
          <img src="assets/meetup/designsystem/iconAudit.png" alt="icon audit">
          <br /><br /><br />
          As was expected with an 18 year old product - we found many version of the product, with many fragments of previous versions of design systems &amp; visual identities.
          <br /><br /><br />

    <div class="projectContent bBreak">
      <h2>Structure</h2>
      <div class="sub7">
        <p>
          Before jumping into Figma and building, we wanted to make sure that our system was set up to be as easy as possible to maintain and work out of.
          <br /><br>
          I set up a 2 part component library structure with a &#34;DS foundations&#34; library containing all of the atomic elements shared across the platforms in addition to a supplemental platform level library for each of the 4 platforms we
          supported &#40;Web, iOS, Android, Email&#41;
          <br /><br />
          This setup allowed us to maintain shared elements like color, typography, spacing, icons, etc. in one place &amp; without redundancy. This also separated the most important style &amp; components into a different file from the platform
          level library, allowing us to have a more restrictive permission on the Foundation library so accidents that had wider impacts were less likely.
          <br /><br />
          We enabled Foundations plus one supplemental platform library by default for each team space in Figma to keep decisions like &#34;which library should I use?&#34; out of the designer&#39;s workflow.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sub10 center">
        <img src="assets/meetup/designsystem/systemStructure.png" alt="system structure" />
      </div>
      <div class="sub7">
        <p>
          This setup helped us maintain a system that allowed for multiple sets of platform specific high-level components and patterns while never having to expose more than 1 set of assets per type to any team space for designer to choose from.

    <div class="projectContent bBreak">
      <h2>Managing scope</h2>
      <div class="sub7">
        <p>
          Working on an established product means there are already lots of components in production. Some still work while others no longer do - sometimes for a hard reason like not passing accessibility, and other times for soft reasons like
          looking dated.
          <br /><br />
          We leaned into adjusting and expanding instead of doing complete rehauls. We focused our time on making the most impact, getting the system up and running quickly, while avoiding oversights that would break existing experiences.
          <br /><br />
          Instead of changing the colors, we took our core colors and expanded our palette to make sure we have accessibility passing options. Instead of creating icons from scratch, I established a keyline, kept the symbols used, and consolidated
          them into a consistent style that later additions followed.

      <div class="sub7">
        <p>
          We applied this philosophy as we built out the rest of our fundational UI elements like inputs, banners, button, etc. - focusing on auditing and consolidating our existing components while staying disciplined about making modifications.

    <div class="projectContent bBreak">
      <h2>Designing for designers</h2>
      <div class="sub7">
        <p>
          I set up time to watch and talk to each designer to learn about how they like to work to make sure we created components in a way that is most condusive to their working style. 3 things jumped out:</p>
        <br /><br />
        <p1>1. The order of operation for finding &amp; setting up components in design files should mimic the designer's thought process</p1>
        <p>
          For example, when our designers need an banner, the thought process goes something like:
          <br /><br />I need a banner > this banner will announce a danger message > it should be persistent at the top of the page, there is no link out or action > but the user should be able to dismiss the banner > I need to attach an
          illustration.<br /><br />
        </p>

        <p1>2. We should ensure feature/variant discoverability</p1>
        <p>
          As the team grew along with the size of component library, it became less practical to announce every addition/adjustment to every single designer every time. To ensure that designers are aware of the options available to them, we needed to
          make sure they are always easily discoverable.<br /><br /></p>

        <p1>3. Overcomplicated components often lead to detaching, under usage and low awareness, and ultimately make mutations more likely.<br /><br /></p1>
        <p>
          We needed to make sure that the components we created were intuitive to use and visually self explanatory instead of relying on writing and tutorials to brute force adoption.<br /><br />
          <br /><br />
          With these priorities in mind, we set up our components to show variant option in the same sequence as the most common order of operation, exposed all of the available parts by default, and put in extra work to set up variants as boolean
          toggles to help with both discovery AND efficiency of use.
          <br /><br /><br />

          <br /><br />
          Elements with uniform behaviors were built as interactive components to drive interaction consistency while saving designer from redundant work during prototyping stage.

      <h2>Building for engineers</h2>
      <div class="sub7">
        <p>
          With every new item we added, we used the elements to recreate existing page to ensure pixel perfection. Through this process, we teased out and fixed the short comings of our components and made sure that any deviation from code was
          intentional and purposeful.

          To ensure that design files always reflect the product that would actually be built, we held weekly meetings with designers and engineers and kept our Storybook repository up to date.

      <h2>Ongoing effort</h2>
      <div class="sub7">
        <p>
          Design system work is not the kind of work that has an end. As we asymptotically approached completing introduction of new components for each platform, we set up feedback loops to ensure the design system continued to meet our needs and
          evolved with our context.
          <br /><br />
          The design of the components started with elements being created &amp; recreated in Figma. As they moved into code, we adjusted &amp; labeled the figma files to accurately reflect the constraints, states, and changes that happened in
          production while continung to optimize them for new UX scenarios we discovered.
          <br /><br />
          I set up a regular cadence of design system meetings with the designers &amp; engineers to discuss what is working and what isn't to make sure problems and improvements were addressed.
          <br /><br />
          The work continues with an emphasis on accessibility &#40;focused on contrast and screenreader&#41; as well as strategies to unify components from web, iOS, android, &amp; email when possible.
