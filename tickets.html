        <p>We went to new hire trainings for customer support staff and followed them around for a couple of weeks to understand the complexities of resolving customer issues.
          <br /><br />We started noticing a few problem areas:</p>

        <i class="fa fa-handshake">&nbsp;</i><strong>Delegating work</strong>
        <br>While agents were efficient at solving simple issues, complex issues that required help from back of house teams like underwriters and processors would often experience long delays or were ignored altogether.

        <br><br><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle">&nbsp;</i><strong>Issue escalation</strong>
        <br>Other than sympathising with the user's discontent, support agents often had few options to escalate issues that were blocked by other functions.

        <br><br><i class="fa fa-code-branch">&nbsp;</i><strong>Complex issues</strong>
        <br />Our previous ticketing solution was built to help support agents focus on one issue at a time. The problem was that these conversation would often evolve and branch into multiple items and follow up issues. These would require ad hoc tracking and were sometimes lost.

        <br><br><i class="fa fa-comments">&nbsp;</i><strong>Communicating challenges</strong>
        <br>As customer issues were passed from one agent to another, context from previous communications with customers were frequently lost, which often led to redundant conversations and unhappy borrowers.

          Ticket tasks are assigned to a specific team or person, notifying them upon assignment, and include all of the context from from the ticket.<br /><br /></p>
