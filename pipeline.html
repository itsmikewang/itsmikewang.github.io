      <div class="fullSpan">
        <div class="sub9 center">
          <p1>We noticed that customer facing mortgage teams were frequently changing the combination of tools they used and the way they use them and wanted to learn more</p1>
        </div>
        <div class="sub3">
          <p2>We set up reoccuring research chats with mortgage professionals at different performance levels to find out what works, what doesn't, and noticed some common pain points.

            <i class="fa fa-wind">&nbsp;</i><strong>Changing winds</strong>- The type of loans that mortgage professionals care about is constantly changing - any change in capital market conditions, company capacity, politics, policy, and an
            infinite number of other factors could mean what used to be top priority are suddenly the last things that should be worked on. It's not abnormal for these kinds of complete shift in priorities to happen every couple of weeks.

            <br><br><i class="fa fa-undo">&nbsp;</i><strong>Re-configure</strong>- With each shift in direction, mortgage teams would have to rely on a different combination of tools to comb through their loans to prioritize and track which to work
            on.


            <br><br><i class="fa fa-search">&nbsp;</i><strong>Detective work</strong>- The traits that makes certain loans high priority and not others are often buried in the details of the loan. Without proper indexing of loan traits, teams often
            have to dig through files one by one to figure out which is worth working on.

            <br><br><i class="fa fa-database">&nbsp;</i><strong>Complicated databases</strong></strong>- Centralized places where teams can see all of the loans they care about are usually filled with way too much irrelevant information. It's very
            hard to slice and dice the the items they see and parse out the ones that matter. The setup often feels like too much effort in a market where conditions can change any day.

        <p>We set out to build a tool that would allow teams to quickly set &amp; adjust filters to keep an eye on all of the loans they care about at once.

          <br /><br />The large amount of filters our users needed to work with presented lots of interesting UX and technical challeneges. So we tested prototypes, built spikes, talked to users, and iterated until we started noticing delight in our
          research participants.
