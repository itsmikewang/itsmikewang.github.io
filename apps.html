        <p>At the start of 2021, the number of events on Meetup began to recover from the quarantine. However, as most metrics like downloads and signups grew, the most important metric of RSVP stayed stagnant on our apps.<br /><br />
        <p1>I dug into the issue with the help of our data team and found 3 obvious problem areas to tackle:<br /><br /></p1>
        <p2>



          <i class="fa fa-sign-out-alt">&nbsp;</i><strong>No return</strong>- Our app user frequently returned as they actively attended events. However, those that went more than 2 week without an RSVP were 5x more likely to never open the app again. Almost all organizers became one after attending 3 events as a member.

          <br /><br /><i class="fa fa-user-clock">&nbsp;</i><strong>No backup</strong>- Users with no RSVP AND no group joins were almost 2x more likely to stop using the app compared to their counterparts who joined at least 1 group. Additionally, our event search tool was prominently featured on the bottom bar while our group search was separate, inline on 1 page, and saw less than 20&percnt; of the usage of event search.

          <br /><br /><i class="fa fa-route">&nbsp;</i><strong>Long leaky onboarding</strong>- While registration growth outpaced RSVPs, it still left a lot of room for improvement. Only 14.3&percnt; of apps users downloaded the apps, registered, AND RSVPd to an event on their first day.

      <p1>Our data suggest that we can drive continuous engagement with our app by nudging users to take action early and keeping events on Meetup top of mind.</p1>

          <p1>To encourage more meaningful actions during the onboarding flow, we -</p1>
          <p>
            <br /> &bull; started making search suggestions
            <br /> &bull; redesigned a more compact group screen to help users discover more groups
            <br /> &bull; added an event join step to encourage RSVPs
            <br /> &bull; added group and event preview cards to make sure users have all of the info they need to commit

        <div class="sub6">
          <p><br /><br />Finally, we decided to flip the order of our onboarding flow to get the user through registration first. After onboarding is complete, we sent users to the Explore page filled with recommendations related to their interests instead of an empty home page.</p>

        <p>We continued to optimize our in-app experience but still needed to address the problem of low rate of returning to app for users who did not have RSVPs.
        <br /><br />We created and began testing widgets to give users a way to passively engage and re-engage with the app by showing relevant upcoming events based on their group joins and past activities.</p>
